update_notes: "This is more of a proof of concept, open source friend application\
  \ than a fully functional application. Things are still quite limited but in working\
  \ condition for now. *The only advantage to this, is that it lets you search for\
  \ friends in your friends list which seems to be the one thing the friends app doesn't\
  \ do*.\r\n\r\nFriendMii consists of the following features:\r\n\r\n- Displays friend\
  \ list. (Use L/R to switch between your friend card and friends list)\r\n- Add/remove\
  \ friends from your friends list.\r\n- Search for friends by their name. (Perhaps\
  \ more filters later :P)\r\n- Displays friend current playing/favourite title ID,\
  \ titleID. (Yeah I know doesn't look very nice but it works)\r\n- Displays friend's\
  \ comment as well as their friend code.\r\n- Displays owner's friend code, favourite\
  \ game, comment etc, online status, hide status etc.\r\n\r\n**If you'd like to support\
  \ me, then feel free to buy me a coffee, I'd really appreciate it! https://www.paypal.me/Joel16IA**"
