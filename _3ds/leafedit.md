  \ Map Editor.\r\n- Added Pattern Editor.\r\n- For a list of editing features, look\
  \ [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/LeafEdit/blob/master/editing-features.md).\r\
  \n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Changed mainpath to `sdmc:/3ds/LeafEdit/`, so move your stuff\
  \ there before updating.\r\n- Changed LeafEdit completely.\r\n- Remove Town Manager.\
  \ (Use Checkpoint for backup and restore instead.)\r\n- Rewrite the core.\r\n- UI\
  \ style changes.\r\n- Switched selections to lists for now.\r\n- English only for\
  \ now until the core is completely done.\r\n- Changed assets, so you need an Internet\
  \ Connection on first startup on this version.\r\n\r\n## This is version 0.2.1,\
  \ because it doesn't have much changes and for v0.3.0, it is not ready yet.\r\n\r\
  \n# The wiki will get an update later for the latest changes. So: **read the wiki\
  \ before starting with LEAFEDIT and make backups**!!!!!\r\n## We are not responsible\
