update_notes: "This release contains several critical fixes for broken things in 3.0.\
  \ They include:\r\n- Include SaltySD files that do not crash after the character\
  \ select screen in Smash (taken from the SaltySD 1.2 release page at https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/SaltySD/releases)\r\
  \n- Correct the updater not working, at all, when trying to grab stuff from GitHub.\
  \ \r\n- Also correct, in the actual release builds, the lack of a #define for BUILTFROM3DSX-\
  \ this will allow the updater to work properly for 3dsx files from now on. The readme\
  \ has also been updated to reflect this.\r\n- Fix an edge case where the user may\
  \ be unable to write a SaltySD file using ModMoon.\r\n- Fix a bug that prevented\
  \ the user from skipping the updater.\r\n- Add a version string within the title\
  \ selection menu.\r\n***VERSION 3.0 IS CRITICALLY BROKEN DUE TO THE NON-FUNCTIONAL\
  \ SALTYSD FILES AND THE BROKEN UPDATER. IF YOU DOWNLOADED 3.0, PLEASE DOWNLOAD 3.0.1\
  \ MANUALLY.***"
