NAND Title Manager, NTM for short, is an application for the Nintendo DSi that allows you to manage titles on your NAND. It can manage titles on both [hiyaCFW](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/hiyacfw/)'s SDNAND and your actual internal memory, typically called SysNAND. **When using in SysNAND mode please use with caution**.
