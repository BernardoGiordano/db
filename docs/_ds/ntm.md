  <p dir="auto">This version fixes a critical bug in the free space calculation that
  I''m near certain is responsible for both bricks NTM has caused, I feel absolutely
  awful about missing this. Typo''d and missed <a href="https://github.com/Epicpkmn11/NTM/commit/b56deb2a59193952f17477a8a2ff0ce72f618bda">one
  "+"</a> causing the app size calculation to be completely broken and somehow didn''t
  notice in my testing.</p>

  <p dir="auto">If you have NTM please update immediately and delete any old versions,
  Unlaunch is still required in this release however if we can go a long while with
  zero reports of issues I <em>MIGHT</em> re-enable non-Unlaunch support in release
  builds.</p>'

NAND Title Manager, NTM for short, is an application for the Nintendo DSi that allows you to manage titles on your NAND. It can manage titles on both [hiyaCFW](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/hiyacfw/)'s SDNAND and your actual internal memory, typically called SysNAND. **When using in SysNAND mode please use with caution**.

Please see the [guide on the wiki](https://github.com/Epicpkmn11/NTM/wiki/How-to-Install-DSiWare) for how to properly and safely use NTM.
