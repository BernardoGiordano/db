  <h3 dir="auto">What''s new?</h3>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Adds an option to the main menu to enable Data Management in System Settings

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>This is done by simply creating an empty file for <code class="notranslate">/sys/dev.kp</code>,
  which causes Data Management to show up</li>

  <li>This could potentially interfere with usage of the DSi Shop, though I think
  the shop would just replace it with with a proper one, but as the shop is dead there''s
  not really any worry</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <h3 dir="auto">Bug fixes</h3>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Changes the free space check to always leave at least 1 MiB free, hopefully
  this is enough margin for error as to prevent any more bricks, like the one reported
  by <a href="https://gbatemp.net/members/thesegakid.550754/" rel="nofollow">TheSegaKid</a>
  on GBAtemp

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>I wish I knew exactly why that happened as I tested, using no$gba, down to the
  exact byte that my space calculations matched up iirc, but it''s likely I missed
  something and since I was allowing such tight margins that allowed it to mess up</li>

  <li>This shouldn''t be a major concern for users with Unlaunch, but especially if
  you don''t have Unlaunch I strongly recommend updating</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

NAND Title Manager, NTM for short, is an application for the Nintendo DSi that allows you to manage titles on your NAND. It can manage titles on both [hiyaCFW](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/hiyacfw/)'s SDNAND and your actual internal memory, typically called SysNAND. **When using in SysNAND mode please use with caution**.
