Protista is an interactive toy where player-created creatures compete for supremacy of the Petri dish. Protista, an experiment in interactivity, challenges both the right and left sides of the brain.

The creative side is unleashed to design and build an assortment of creatures in a full-featured creature editor. Protista tasks the analytic side to program the creatures with a graphical programming language.

Then, the whole brain can sit back and watch its creations battle it out in a struggle of microscopic proportions.

Protista includes the following game modes:

Sandbox - A quick way to see your creature in action in a free-play environment.
Creature Studio - Dreams of oddness become reality.
AI Lab - Aspiring programmers can develop programs to transform peace-loving microbes into killing machines.
Race Track - A creature's mobility is put to the test.
Battle Arena - Creatures are forced to fight until one creature is pushing up seaweed.
