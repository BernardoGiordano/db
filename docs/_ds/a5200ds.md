update_notes: <p>Version 1.8. Major cleanup of speedup attempts that wasn't working
  correctly - this should allow collision detection to work properly now. More games
  work - NTSC is the default console. Better screen handling across the board. Robotron
  2084 is playable with A,X,Y,B buttons as the fire buttons (awesome!). Zone Ranger
  is now playable.</p>
