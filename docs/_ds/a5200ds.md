update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V3.5a : 06-Jan-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Major cleanup across the board - a few more frames of performance and many games
  on the older DS-Lite will now run full speed without frameskip.</li>

  <li>Touch of paint on the main emulation screen to make the console buttons a bit
  more prominent.</li>

  <li>New X button handling on the games that utilize more than 192 vertical pixels
  to smooth scroll upper/lower areas of the screen (usually just status/score in those
  areas so pressing the X button to bring them momentarily into view works fine).</li>

  <li>About 50 new homebrews and hacks added to the internal database (up to 240 games
  now).</li>

  <li>Version 3.5a improves keyboard debounce and adds a new Star Raiders custom overlay!
  Fixes for Phobos. Fixes for sound pops.</li>

  </ul>'
