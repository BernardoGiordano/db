update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V4.0 : 20-Jan-2025 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Major overhaul to add "Cycle Exact" Antic and GTIA which fixes many glitches
  and artifacts.</li>

  <li>There are now two builds... one for the older DS-Phat/Lite and one for the DSi
  (or XL/LL) which brings in a higher level of compatibility with the "Cycle Exact"
  timing.</li>

  <li>Improved keyboard overlays - added alphanumeric keyboard with text-adventure
  macros.</li>

  <li>Improved memory handling - using more memory but in an efficient way for the
  new features.</li>

  <li>Improved sound handling - new SIO sounds, new opening jingle.</li>

  <li>Improved CPU handling to fix one more Acid800 test (25 pass now).</li>

  <li>Fixed keyboard handling so games like Scorch will register keypresses (broken
  as of V3.0).</li>

  <li>Added some of the more obscure missing .CAR cartridge types.</li>

  <li>So much changed under the hood that old config files will be wiped and old save
  states will not work. Sorry!</li>
