update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V4.1 : 25-Jan-2025 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Refactor the OS Enable/Disable on XL/XE emulation to avoid moving large blocks
  of memory. Speeds up many games that swap the OS in/out.</li>

  <li>Improved SIO/Disk handling - sound effects reduced in volume and now configurable
  (default is OFF).</li>

  <li>Improved cart/disk loading and all disks are left mounted when RESET is pressed
  allowing you to load up a system the way you want.</li>

  <li>A dozen new .CAR cartridge types supported including DCART (Bubble Bobble homebrew).</li>

  <li>Tweak to the TWL++ icon for A8DS to make it look a bit more classic.</li>

  <li>Many small cleanups and improvements and a few bug fixes as well.</li>

  </ul>'
