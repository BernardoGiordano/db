update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V3.2 : 13-May-2023 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Enhanced configuration - unfortunately your old config save will be wiped to
  make way for the new method.</li>

  <li>Global options - use the GEAR icon before a game is loaded and you can save
  out defaults for newly loaded games.</li>

  <li>Key maps - set any of the DS keys to map into various joystick, console buttons,
  keyboard keys, etc.</li>

  <li>Screenshot capability - press and hold L+R for ~1 second to take a .bmp snapshot
  (saved to a time-date.bmp file)</li>

  <li>New Smooth Scroll handling so you can set your scale/offset and then map any
  button to shift vertical/horizontal pixels (set keys to VERTICAL++, HORIZONTAL--,
  etc). The game will automatically smooth-scroll back into place when you let go
  of the pixel-shift button.</li>

  <li>Improved cart banking so that it''s as fast as normal memory swaps. This should
  eliminate slowdown in Cart-based games.</li>

  <li>A few bug fixes as time permitted.</li>

  </ul>'
