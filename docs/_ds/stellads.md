update_notes: '<p>Version 2.2<br>

  This release includes a modest speed improvement for all of the difficult-to-render
  games... in some cases as much as 15% speed improvement is given to games that have
  lots of playfield stuff going on... it comes at a cost of a few frames per second
  on some of the easier to render games. This is a great trade-off since those simpler
  games have frames to spare... this makes games like Fantastic Voyage which was running
  at 43FPS now run at 60FPS.  The hardest-to-render game is Elevators Amiss which
  was running at 35FPS but now runs at 46FPS - more than 20% faster and now in the
  realm of playable. Enjoy!</p>'
