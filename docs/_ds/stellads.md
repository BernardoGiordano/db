update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V7.9 : 04-Dec-2024 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Fix so holding shoulder buttons on Bumper Bash does NOT invoke the screen snapshot.</li>

  <li>Fix for bumper bash right bumper position so it now shows correctly.</li>

  <li>Improved GI Joe Cobra Strike snake graphics so it''s much closer to the way
  a real TIA chip would draw it.</li>

  <li>Fix for Labyrinth (AR) graphical glitches at top/bottom of walls.</li>

  <li>Improved difficulty switch handling so startup values for games like Asteroids
  works correctly.</li>

  <li>Improved RIOT timer emulation - Acid Drop, Panda Chase, Zoo Fun and a few other
  PAL roms now work.</li>

  <li>Improved keyboard/keypad emulation so games like Alpha Beam with Ernie, Oscar''s
  Trash Can Race and Magicard now work.</li>

  <li>Improved emulation of Starpath Supercharger (AR) games (Dragonstomper is random)
  and support smaller game loads (Cubis now runs).</li>

  <li>Fixed Casino paddles (correct paddle emulation so you can select all card positions
  in game variation 4).</li>

  <li>Internal cart database updated to Romhunter v19 (full NTSC with select PAL titles).</li>

  <li>Fix for save/load states on CDFJ+ carts (Gorf and Turbo Arcade will now save/load
  correctly).</li>

  <li>Wave Direct improvements - applying the same logic for all games that utilize
  digital speech and improving sounds.</li>

  <li>Added new Stretch-X config option to stretch the screen horizontally (you can
  use offset/stretch to fill the screen for some Activision games which purposely
  hide the HMOVE blanks on the left side of the screen).</li>

  <li>Pressing and holding the Game Select and Game Reset buttons now keeps them depressed
  until you let up your finger.</li>
