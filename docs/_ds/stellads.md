update_notes: '<p>V2.0 : 26-Jan-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Faster AR processing rendering some of the more stubborn games playable.</li>

  <li>Faster screen rendering for more complicated games. Simple games take a small<br>

  performance hit (think: games with solid backgrounds) but those were already<br>

  running plenty fast enough - to we took the trade off to make some of the<br>

  more complicated games faster - this is an overall win for most games!</li>

  <li>General cleanup - more games rendering properly (screen offset/scaling tweaks).</li>

  </ul>'
