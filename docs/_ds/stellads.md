update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V6.2 : 05-Dec-2022 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>New WAVE DIRECT sound handling for fast-fetching music. Draconian, Mappy, Stay
  Frosty 2, Stella''s Stocking, Pitfall II and Quadrun have much improved sound.</li>

  <li>New palette options to tweak the colors to your liking.</li>

  <li>Memory re-org for a bit more speed but also to recover some valuable resources
  so more features can be added in the future.</li>

  <li>Added a 2nd page (not yet populated) for possible future options. This requires
  a new configuration file format - your old one will be reset. Sorry!</li>

  <li>Fixed CDFJ+ fetchers causing problems (including incorrect handling of SaveKey).</li>

  <li>Other small improvements as time permitted.</li>

  </ul>'
