update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V10.1: 03-Sep-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Fix for the ADC decimal-mode instruction in the 6502 core for the CreatiVision.
  This fixes a number of problems including hex-digits showing on scores for some
  games.</li>

  <li>Tweaks and optimizations for the CreatiVision driver. Added most of the common/stable
  ''undocumented'' opcodes.</li>

  <li>Improved emulation accuracy for the ADAM with memory now initialized to alternating
  0x00 (even bytes) and 0xFF (odd bytes) per AdamEM and experiments from Shawn Merrick.</li>

  </ul>'
