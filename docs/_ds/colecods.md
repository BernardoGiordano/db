update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V9.5: 30-Mar-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>ADAMnet improvement for disk/tape handling. Improved timing, improved caching
  and more disk/tape games should load and run correctly.</li>

  <li>DSI gets a massive 2MB of Expansion RAM (32 banks of 64K). DS-Lite/Phat still
  has 128K (base 64K plus the standard 64K expansion RAM).</li>

  <li>Adam now properly handles 320K disks and three drive bays are virtually attached
  (two 320K disk drives and the internal Tape drive at 256K).</li>

  <li>Adam full keyboard now uses an LED indicator under the CAPS LOCK button to indicate
  status.</li>

  <li>Adam has improved keyboard graphic with more keys added.</li>

  <li>Adam no longer mirrors RAM as a Colecovision would.</li>

  <li>Adam optimization provided 5% improved emulation speed which should make most
  everything playable even on the older DS-Lite/Phat.</li>

  <li>Adam supports the 32K expanded ROM and running carts under Adam emulation -
  name your ROMs as .adm so it loads into the right place in memory.</li>

  <li>Tatung Einstein now has two proper standard 200K disk drives.</li>

  <li>Tatung Einstein full keyboard now uses LED indicators under the SHIFT/CTRL/GRAPH
  and ALPHA LOCK keys for a visual improvement.</li>

  <li>Tatung Einstein properly handles the backspace key when using the Alpha-Numeric
  keyboard overlay.</li>

  <li>2000 individual game configurations are supported - save/load states optimized
  and numerous tweaks under the hood.</li>
