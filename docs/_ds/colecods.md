update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V7.3: 31-May-2022 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Massive optimization of the VDP core and memory handling so we are now almost
  35% faster on Colecovision games and more than 10% faster on all other systems.</li>

  <li>Due to these optmizations, the DrZ80 core has been removed and only the high-compatibility
  CZ80 core remains.</li>
