update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V9.8: 23-Apr-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Cleanup of MSX BIOS handling - we now support the Panasonic CF-2700 directly.
  See MSX BIOS section for details.</li>

  <li>MSX status line now shows RAM (based on machine chosen) on the status line (was
  previously showing ROM size which no other machine in ColecoDS did).</li>

  <li>MSX Caps Lock now has LED indicator on the virtual keyboard.</li>

  <li>Added ROM/CAS/DSK size and CRC32 on the main screen after choosing a game.</li>

  <li>Numerous fixes for Save/Load states especially for the MSX and Einstein.</li>

  <li>Improved memory handling to free up some DS resources for future expansion.</li>
