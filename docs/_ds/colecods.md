update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V6.6: 07-Apr-2022 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>CAS icon implemented to provide a menu of cassette-based actions including swapping
  tape/disk for multi-load games.</li>

  <li>SC-3000 emulated more fully with support for the SC-3000 Survivors Multi-Cart.</li>

  <li>PAL vs NTSC now supported for the Memotech MTX, Spectravideo SVI and SC-3000.</li>

  <li>SAV files have been streamlined and are now smaller/faster. Old saves won''t
  work. Sorry.</li>

  <li>Better overall memory handling to keep the program size manageable.</li>
