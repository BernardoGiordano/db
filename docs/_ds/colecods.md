update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V8.3: 10-Aug-2023 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Fix for keyboard handler so that more than one key can be pressed at a time
  (otherwise you get stutter when moving/shooting in keyboard-mapped games).</li>

  <li>Major overhaul of the Memotech MTX emulation to improve emulation, sound and
  general stability.</li>

  <li>New Z80 CTC handler (mainly for Memotech) which provides more accurate sound
  in Sord M5 and some Einstein games.</li>

  <li>New Tatung Einstein keyboard graphic and improved keyboard handling.</li>

  <li>New keymap presets for common keyboard games (QAOP, WASD, ZC-Period, etc.) -
  use the X button to rotate through these when defining keys.</li>

  <li>Other tweaks, fixes and improvements as time permitted.</li>

  </ul>'
