update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V8.9: 20-Sep-2023 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Further cleanup of the ADAM driver to eliminate title-screen glitches and provide
  support for 320K disks.</li>

  <li>Slight optmization across the board resulting in another frame or two of performance.</li>

  <li>Memory optmization to reduce the footprint of the program - providing about
  300K of free resources total.</li>

  <li>Improved speed of blend mode (it only uses about 10% CPU resources now)</li>

  </ul>'
