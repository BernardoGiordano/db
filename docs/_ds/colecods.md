update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V7.5: 18-June-2022 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Major update to the way internal memory is handled. It''s slimmer, trimmer and
  much faster across-the-board. More games run at full speed.</li>

  <li>Fixed EE and SRAM handling on MSX games - those also now back to files on the
  SD card so you can pick up where you left off.</li>

  <li>Improvements to the Sord M5 driver so more games run correctly - Mahjong now
  works.</li>

  <li>Improvements to the Coleco/ADAM driver so more games run correctly. Boulder
  Dash works properly and more ADAM disk games run properly.</li>

  </ul>'
