update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V10.4: 10-Mar-2025 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>DSi now supports cart ROMs up to 4MB (4096K). Only a few MSX tech demos / games
  get anywhere near this.</li>

  <li>New super-simplified Colecovision CPU driver that is used for most of the well-behaved
  Colecovision games to render them full speed on the older DS-Lite/Phat.</li>

  <li>Improved emulation speed of the 6502 core to render all Creativision games at
  full speed on older DS-Lite/Phat.</li>

  <li>Corrected a few cycle timings and generally improved accuracy of the Z80 CPU
  driver.</li>

  </ul>'
