update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V8.8: 11-Sep-2023 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Major cleanup of the Coleco ADAM driver so that most games now load up first
  try and RESET handling is smooth and consistent.</li>

  <li>For the ADAM, added toggle between full keyboard and the joystick/joypad so
  now you don''t have to choose one layout or the other.</li>

  <li>Simplified keyboard handling. Now the user just picks ''Full Keyboard'' and
  the emulator will figure out the best keyboard overlay to use based on the machine
  being emulated.</li>

  </ul>'
