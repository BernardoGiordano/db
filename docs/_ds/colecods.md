update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V8.4: 15-Aug-2023 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Added SVI keyboard graphic and improved SVI keyboard handling.</li>

  <li>Added Sega SC-3000 keyboard graphic and improved SC-3000 keyboard handling.</li>

  <li>Improved PV-2000 keyboard handling.</li>

  <li>Added preliminary keyboard support for Hanimex Pencil II - just enough to run
  BASIC if you dare.</li>

  <li>Spectravideo SVI-3x8 cartridges supported up to 64K. Load .rom and the emulator
  will figure it out.</li>

  <li>Fixed bug with VDP re-enable of interrupts (unsure if this affected anything,
  but it''s corrected anyway).</li>

  <li>Ability to run games at 90% to 130% on a per-game basis (See game configuration).</li>

  <li>Improved mixing of SN+AY sound chips for the few games that utilize both.</li>

  <li>Refactor of keypad graphics and fix for the options overlay so it paints the
  whole screen without graphical problems (e.g. showing part of the underlying screen).
  This also frees up precious RAM!</li>

  <li>Other tweaks, fixes and improvements as time permitted.</li>

  </ul>'
