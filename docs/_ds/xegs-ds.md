update_notes: <p>Version 1.2 adds built-in BASIC support (thanks to Avery Lee and
  the open-source Altirra project) which allows a wider variety of games to be played.
  A few new optimizations. Fixes for PAL sound and framerate.  You can now tap the
  lower right corner of the touch screen to toggle A=UP which makes games that have
  a lot of jumping more enjoyable with a D-Pad (Alley Cat, etc).</p>
