update_notes: '<p>V2.6 : 11-Jul-2021 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <p>Reduced down to one screen buffer - this cleans up ghosting visible sometimes
  on dark backgrounds.<br>

  If atarixl.rom exists, it is used by default (previously had still been defaulting
  to Altirra rom).<br>

  New screen blending types to provide more options for screen scaling improvements.<br>

  Minor cleanups as time permitted.</p>'
