update_notes: '<p>V1.8 : 25-Feb-2021 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Added option for slower I/O (disk reads) as a few games will detect that<br>

  the game is not running at the right speed and not play (copy protection<br>

  of a sort ... 1980s style). So you can now slow down the I/O to get those<br>

  games running.</li>

  <li>Reverted to "Old NTSC Artifacting" after discovering at least one game<br>

  does not play nicely with the new artificating. Still investigating but<br>

  this cures the problem for now (the game was Stellar Shuttle).</li>

  <li>Added the R-TIME8 module for time/date on some versions of DOS.</li>

  <li>Other minor cleanups as time permitted.</li>
