update_notes: '<p dir="auto">A clone of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html"
  rel="nofollow">Wordle</a> for the Nintendo DS/DSi.</p>

  <p dir="auto">My family has been playing it recently and the JavaScript is too modern
  for all my handheld devices so I had to use my laptop, but I figured <em>I could
  make this on DS</em>... so I did.</p>

  <p dir="auto">It should be more or less feature complete with the original. The
  daily word matches, it tracks your stats, has high contrast colors/hard mode options,
  etc. It even makes a txt file with the shareable emoji grid so you can send that
  to your friends if you want. It also has most of the fancy animations, had a fun
  time figuring out how to affine transform sprites and such for those lol.</p>

  <p dir="auto"><code>WordleDS.nds</code> and <code>WordleDS.dsi</code> are identical
  except that the <code>.dsi</code> build has a title ID so it can be installed using
  <a href="https://github.com/JeffRuLz/TMFH/releases">TMFH</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Epicpkmn11/NTM/releases">NTM</a>
  while the <code>.nds</code> build doesn''t so it works on flashcards. The <code>.cia</code>
  build can be used to install to the 3DS HOME Menu, here''s a QR:</p>
