description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Striving for
  accuracy and speed on the venerable DS handheld. Don't expect perfect emulation
  but things are good enough to enjoy Atari's last major 8-bit console.

update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V4.7 : 11-May-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>X and Y buttons now shift the screen down/up by 16 pixels so you can position
  the score off-screen and use these to pan up/down to see it.</li>

  <li>Fix for Supercarts so that they start in bank 0 (Legend of Silverpeak should
  now load)</li>

  <li>Internal database tweaks for the latest homebrews and ports.</li>

  <li>Other minor tweaks and improvements as time permitted.</li>
