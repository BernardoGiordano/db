description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Striving for
  accuracy and speed on the venerable Nintendo handheld. Don't expect perfect emulation
  but things are good enough to enjoy Atari's last major 8-bit console.

update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V3.8 : 26-Oct-2022 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Massive optmization of the Maria rendering to help the DS-Lite run more games.</li>

  <li>Fix for Rampage</li>

  <li>Fix for Rescue on Fractalus</li>

  <li>Fix for F-18 Hornet</li>

  <li>Fix for Double Dragon</li>

  <li>Fix for Basketbrawl</li>

  <li>Better A78 header parsing for improved game detection</li>

  <li>New Moderate Frameskip to show 3/4 frames (not as aggressive as the old 1/2
  frameskip)</li>

  <li>Support for 1024K (+128 byte header) games. Only a few tech demos available
  so far.</li>

  <li>Removed most of the old hacks for DS-Lite as the speed is good enough to render
  those games properly.</li>
