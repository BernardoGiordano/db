description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Playability
  is more important to me than accuracy. It's no fun if the game won't run.

update_notes: '<p>Version 1.8 with CPU Core improvements and maximum speed on DSi
  and above. Special DS-LITE version included if you want to try this on older hardware
  - but be warned, the compatibility is VERY low on the DS-LITE version so only try
  it with small games (Asteroids, Joust, Centipede, Meteor Shower, Moon Cresta, etc).</p>

  <p>Otherwise stick to the normal A7800DS.NDS file for maximum compatibility and
  speed on the DSi or better hardware.</p>'
