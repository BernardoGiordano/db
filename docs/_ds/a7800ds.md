description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Striving for
  accuracy and speed on the venerable DS handheld. Don't expect perfect emulation
  but things are good enough to enjoy Atari's last major 8-bit console.

update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V4.9 : 17-Feb-2025 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>High Score (HSC) auto-save improvements - no longer write the backing .hsc file
  if the write didn''t actually change HSC data.</li>

  <li>Improved Sally emulation accuracy and optimization pass to render the games
  3-4% faster.</li>

  <li>Improved Pokey emulation - missing sounds on games like Ballblazer are now much
  better.</li>

  <li>Improved memory emulation for more accurate mirror handling - 7800 Utility cart
  now shows this as a PASS.</li>

  <li>Improved memory caching to help with the really big games (those 512K or larger).</li>

  <li>All but two games on the DSi are now rendered without any form of frameskip.
  Older DS-Lite/Phat reduces frameskip due to new optimizations.</li>

  </ul>'
