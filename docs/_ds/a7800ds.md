description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Playability
  is more important to me than accuracy. It's no fun if the game won't run. So don't
  expect perfect emulation but things are good enough to enjoy Atari's last major
  8-bit console.

update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V3.7 : 23-Oct-2022 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Optmization across the board for faster and smoother performance.</li>

  <li>Gained enough speed that we have restored full HQ sound for the DS-Lite.</li>

  <li>bonQ fixed graphical glitches.</li>

  <li>Keystone Koppers fixed graphical glitches.</li>

  <li>Latest homebrews added to the internal database.</li>

  <li>New configuration menu so you can tweak settings - new homebrews won''t need
  a new A7800DS.</li>

  <li>Better A78 v3 header support so more games run right.</li>

  </ul>
