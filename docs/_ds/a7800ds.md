description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Playability
  is more important to me than accuracy. It's no fun if the game won't run.

update_notes: <p>Version 1.7 - minor cleanup overall. Improvement to memory read to
  speed it up (5% boost across the board). Also, finally ditched Kangaroo mode - it
  can be compiled in but virtually no game uses it and the one I know of that does
  (BeefDrop) seems to only use it on the title/attract screen. It was sucking up more
  DS CPU time than it was worth.</p>
