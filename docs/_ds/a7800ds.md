description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Striving for
  accuracy and speed on the venerable DS handheld. Don't expect perfect emulation
  but things are good enough to enjoy Atari's last major 8-bit console.

  and with better debounce.</li>

  <li>Improved magnifying glass icon debounce so that it registers more consistently
  and with better debounce.</li>

  <li>New game icon to align with the other emulators in the Atari lineup on the DS.</li>
