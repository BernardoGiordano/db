description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Striving for
  accuracy and speed on the venerable DS handheld. Don't expect perfect emulation
  but things are good enough to enjoy Atari's last major 8-bit console.

update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V4.6 : 06-May-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Each game that utilizes a High Score Cart (HSC) gets its own 2K .hsc file</li>

  <li>Improved High Score Cart (HSC) emulation - improved initialization of the SRAM
  contents.</li>

  <li>Sanity checks added so that carts marked as ''NORMAL'' (or selected as such)
  but are larger than 48K will not corrupt memory.</li>

  <li>New magnifying glass icon to ZOOM (and center) the display 1:1 with real 7800
  output. This will crop on a DS/DSi since it only has 256x192 but very useful to
  toggle the 1:1 zoom for High Score Entries, etc.</li>

  <li>Support for .a78 V4 headers (will fall back to V3 if not available)</li>

  </ul>'
