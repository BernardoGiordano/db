description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Striving for
  accuracy and speed on the venerable Nintendo handheld. Don't expect perfect emulation
  but things are good enough to enjoy Atari's last major 8-bit console.

update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V4.2 : 06-Nov-2022 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Added support for bankswitched RAM (32K of RAM switched in 16K chunks). This
  makes the Ex version of 1942 playable.</li>

  <li>Added alternate way of handling bankswitched RAM the same way as the DragonFly
  cart or SN board: via writes to 0xFFFF.</li>

  <li>Fix graphical glitch for Ballblazer (just hiding it off screen).</li>

  <li>Numerous small updates to the internal cart database to ensure game run with
  the proper settings (mostly High Scores)</li>

  <li>New 8x density on the High Score Cart - transparent to the user but provides
  more slots so the HSC won''t fill up.</li>

  <li>Flat 32K plus RAM cart type supported.</li>

  <li>Pokey <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/800/hovercard"
  data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/800">@800</a>
  supported for upcoming homebrews.</li>
