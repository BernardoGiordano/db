description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Playability
  is more important to me than accuracy. It's no fun if the game won't run.

update_notes: <p>Version 2 brings in the new Pokey/TIA sound core which improves sound
  considerably. Not perfect, but now very listenable. This comes at a cost of emulation
  speed so please run this on a DSi or 3DS. On the DS-LITE you will have to run the
  older 1.9 LITE version which has very low compatibility (but the games it runs,
  will run at close to full speed).</p>
