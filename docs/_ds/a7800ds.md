update_notes: '<p>Fixed High Score saving. High Score Saving works if you have highscore.rom
  (exact name and case) in your<br>

  roms directory where you load your games... also, you MUST press the HSC button<br>

  if you want to snap the Saved Scores out to the flash card. It''s not something<br>

  I want to do as the game runs... so you must do it... the high scores will also<br>

  auto-save if you quit the emulator or select a new game.</p>'
