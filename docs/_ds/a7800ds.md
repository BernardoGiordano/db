description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Playability
  is more important to me than accuracy. It's no fun if the game won't run.

update_notes: <p>Version 2.1 with memory improvements using DTCM and VRAM so buffer
  moves are faster. Creates a 10% speed improvement across the board.  Use the normal
  A7800DS.nds version for DSi and 3DS but for the older DS-LITE and DS-PHAT, you'll
  have to use the far less complete A7800DS-LITE to get any sort of close approximation
  of speed.</p>
