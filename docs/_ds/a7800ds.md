description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Playability
  is more important to me than accuracy. It's no fun if the game won't run.

  for games that require it (Serpentine works now). Undocumented OP Codes for the
  Sally processor now implemented so games like Popeye will run fine. Other tweaks
  and improvements as time permitted.</p>
