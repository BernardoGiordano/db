update_notes: '<ul dir="auto">

  <li>Debug Mode setting now actually does something. :P</li>

  <li>R4, M3DS Real, and DSXtreme now boot correctly.</li>

  <li>Many more flashcarts that weren''t working probably work now.</li>

  <li>Legacy Bootloader appears to have no advantage over new one. If reports of no
  issues with default bootloader with obscure flashcarts, it may be removed from next
  release pending feedback.</li>

  <li>DSi System Menu/HiyaCFW copy now actually contains NTR_Launcher in the release
  zip. I had included ntr bootstrap by mistake in the v2.5 release zip. This has been
  resolved in this new release.</li>

A DS Slot-1 Launcher. Original code from NitroHax but with cheat engine/menu stripped out. Useful for launching older DS flashcarts.
Credits go to Chishm for NitroHax which this source is based from and WinterMute for dslink source/reset code.
