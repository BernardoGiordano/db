update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V4.9 : 01-Feb-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Improved cheat database selection - after selecting cheats, just press START
  to reset and apply cheats directly on the cheat picker screen.</li>

  <li>Improved bankswitching/paged roms so that partially filled banks can be switched
  (some recent homebrews require this).</li>

  <li>Updated internal database so more games load and run properly without tweaks.</li>

  <li>Minor cleanups across the board as time permitted.</li>

  </ul>'
