update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V3.9 : 05-Mar-2023 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Improved ECS keyboard handling so we can handle ''transposed'' scanning of columns/rows
  (allows demos like Adventure to run).</li>

  <li>Improved banking / page-flipping for faster page switches and more robust. There
  should be no more small audio ''gaps'' when page-flipping music.</li>

  <li>For the DSi we now support 1024KB (512K Words) of binary ROM which is almost
  unfathomably large in the world of Intellivision games (130% larger than anything
  I''m aware of).</li>

  </ul>'
