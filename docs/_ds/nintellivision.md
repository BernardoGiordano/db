update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V3.7 : 23-Dec-2022 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>First pass at ECS style page flipping (aka bankswap). It only handles 3 pages
  deep so it''s enough to play Major League World Series Baseball but not the more
  complex ECS-style homebrews.</li>

  <li>Improved error handling with better messages on-screen to help diagnose problems
  with missing roms, roms that are too big/complex, etc.</li>

  <li>Cleanup across the board - reorganized memory to free up more resources for
  the future.</li>

  </ul>'
