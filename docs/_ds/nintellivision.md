update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V4.4 : 30-Oct-2023 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Major overhaul of configuration to provide for better future enhancements. Your
  old configurations will be wiped in favor of the new defaults.</li>

  <li>Major cleanup of overlay support - gone are the built-in overlays except for
  the normal Intellivision controller graphic and the mini-ECS keyboard. All other
  overlays are stored externally and a library of more than 40 custom overlays for
  personal use are provided.</li>

  <li>Simplified use of custom overlays - if the .ovl file exists (with the same base
  name as the .ROM or .BIN file), it will automatically be loaded and used (you no
  longer need to specify that the overlay is ''Custom'').</li>

  <li>Other minor cleanups and tweaks as time permitted.</li>

  </ul>'
