update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V5.7a : 19-Oct-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Fix to allow JLP games to execute out of 16-bit RAM. Fixes Defender of the Crown.</li>

  <li>Fix ECS keyboard emulation to properly read back either port if configured for
  output (was causing FWDiagnostics to fail).</li>

  <li>Improved UI display of ''JLP FLASH'' so it shows a bit longer (but doesn''t
  interfere with emulation speed)</li>

  <li>Numerous new overlays added and updated some older ones.</li>

  <li>Version 5.7a has a small fix for game loading/selection and we''re now at almost
  170 overlays!</li>

  </ul>'
