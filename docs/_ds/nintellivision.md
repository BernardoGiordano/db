update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V4.5 : 01-Jan-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Added new Screenshot handling (press and hold the L+R shoulder buttons for ~1
  second to take a .bmp snapshot written to the SD card)</li>

  <li>Added new meta key mapping to un-throttle (Speedup) the emulator. Useful for
  games where your character is resting and you want the emulator to run the frames
  as fast as it can.</li>

  <li>Minor cleanup on the internal database for the latest and greatest homebrew
  games.</li>

  <li>Lots of new and improved overlays in the extras.zip pack.</li>

  </ul>'
