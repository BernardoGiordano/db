update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V4.6 : 15-Jan-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Massive overhaul to the core emulation to reduce memory footprint. The older
  DS-Lite/Phat (with 4MB of memory) can now load all of the newest homebrew games!</li>

  <li>Optimizations in Video, Audio and CPU cores provides 10% speed up across the
  board.</li>

  <li>Improved sound quality for the DSi including a new "BEST" option (not enabled
  by default) that will render the sound as good as I can make it on the handheld.</li>

  <li>A few small fixes for the CPU core to improve the cycle accuracy.</li>

  <li>With the improved speed, the DSi largely disables frameskip for the best visual
  experience.</li>

  </ul>'
