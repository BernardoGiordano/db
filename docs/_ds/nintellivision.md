update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V3.8 : 26-Dec-2022 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Improved memory handling so we don''t run out of memory on the DS-Lite/Phat
  and no more crashes!</li>

  <li>ECS and extra cart RAM now in faster VRAM to improve performance.</li>

  <li>Fixed sound channels so that PSG + ECS + Intelivoice can all play nice together
  (mostly for World Series of Baseball)</li>

  <li>Improved .ROM parsing support - now checking the CRC integrity and properly
  parsing the compatibility tags so more games run with the right settings (Intellivoice
  or JLP or ECS, etc).</li>

  <li>New Game/Emulator Information screen to let you know if you are running in DS
  compatibility mode (less RAM, slower CPU) or DSi compatibilty mode (more RAM and
  faster CPU).</li>

  <li>For the DSi or above we now support a much wider range of binary files (up to
  512K) with page flipping.</li>

  <li>New menu to allow you to launch a game with specific hardware configurations.
  Use X to load the game instead of A (launch instructions are on-screen).</li>

  <li>Lots of small improvements and cleanup as time permitted.</li>

  </ul>'
