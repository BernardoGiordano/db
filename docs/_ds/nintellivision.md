update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V5.6 : 06-Oct-2024 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Massive overhaul to the way overlays are found and loaded. No longer do you
  need to have the overlays named the same as the game ROM file - the emulator should
  find the matching overlay 99% of the time (and yes, you can still force the issue
  by naming the .ovl the same as the base game .int/.bin/.rom file)</li>

  <li>If the system BIOS files are not found by name, a quick search is done by CRC32
  to see if the emulator can load it.</li>

  <li>These improvements should go a long way to helping people get their Nintellivision
  system running quickly and with less fuss.</li>

  </ul>'
