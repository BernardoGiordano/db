update_notes: '<p>It''s been a while!</p>

  <p>With this release, I revamped the entire build system. There are no new features
  for this release (other than a version number on the main menu), but there are bugfixes
  that have never had a proper build in years.</p>

  <p>Picking up this project again to solve some of the age-old issues has been difficult
  because I haven''t had a usable build system that could build all platforms. For
  this update, all supported platforms are now compiled through CMake, and the old
  Makefiles/buildtools has been dropped completely.</p>

  <p>Additionally, I created Containerfiles for building the 3DS, Switch, TI-Nspire,
  and Linux platforms. This should hopefully make it easier to make modifications
  ensuring I can still build all supported platforms going into the future.</p>

  <p>I hope the addition of Containerfiles and the unification of all platforms to
  CMake makes it easier for other contributors to set up a sane build environment.
  If you have issues with these build systems, please open an issue or PR.</p>

  <p><em>Note: The levels are now built-into the TI-Nspire binary, SuperHaxagon.tns.
  You no longer need <code class="notranslate">levels.haxagon</code> to be present</em></p>'
