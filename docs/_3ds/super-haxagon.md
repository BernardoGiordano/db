update_notes: "<h1>Super Haxagon 3.4.0</h1>\n<h3>About this build:</h3>\n<p>Most systems\
  \ haven't significantly changed across platforms. All have been tested on hardware.\
  \ This is primarily a release for the TI-Nspire but I'll upload new builds here\
  \ to keep them up to date.</p>\n<p>As for the TI-Nspire build the credits and beatmaps\
  \ are not currently working.</p>\n<p><g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"warning\"\

  \ fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a0.png\"\
  >\u26A0\uFE0F</g-emoji></p>\n<h3>A summary:</h3>\n<p>I've finally come back to what\
  \ started my programming adventure. A simple app for a calculator. In 2013 I released\
  \ the program \"Super Hexaspire\" as an alpha. At the time I had no idea that programming\
  \ would turn into a career.</p>\n<p>So here we are today, porting a game around\
  \ to so many different platforms. Starting with the Nspire, moving to the 3DS, then\
  \ to PC, then to the Switch, and finally back to the Nspire. Super Haxagon has been\
  \ quite a project over the years and taught me many things about technology, and\
  \ for that I am grateful.</p>\n<h3>Timeline:</h3>\n<p>2013: TI-Nspire version Alpha<br>\n\
  2016: 3DS version 1<br>\n2017: 3DS version 2 (Complete Rewrite)<br>\n2020: 3DS version\
  \ 3 (Complete Rewrite)<br>\n2020: Windows and Linux release<br>\n2020: Nintendo\
