update_notes: '<p>It has been two years since the official YouTube app on 3DS was
  discontinued.<br>

  Several new features were added to ThirdTube on the other hand.</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Added the ability to show comment replies</li>

  <li>Added support for long comments and comment folding function</li>

  <li>Added support for subtitles</li>

  <li>Added duration text overlaid on the thumbnail in the search page</li>

  <li>Added full screen mode (configurable in settings menu)</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug where channel pages would not load more videos</li>

  <li>Removed FPS indicator at the top left<br>

  It was removed because it does not show the FPS of the video but the FPS of rendering
  and caused confusion.</li>

  </ul>'
