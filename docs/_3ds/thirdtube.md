update_notes: '<ul>

  <li>Added support for livestreams and premiere videos<br>

  Due to the way it works, smooth playing of livestreams cannot be expected unless
  you have a very stable connection.<br>

  Live chat is not supported yet.<br>

  You can access to a livestream before it starts, but you''ll have to press Advanced
  -&gt; Reload in order to watch it when it starts.</li>

  <li>Added more metadata in video player and other pages

  <ul>

  <li>View count, published date, like count and dislike count in the video page</li>

  <li>Uploader and duration in video suggestion page</li>

  <li>Subscribers count and video count for channels, view count and published date
  for videos in search results</li>

  <li>Published date and view count in channel video list</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>New icon and banner (thanks <a class="user-mention" data-hovercard-type="user"
  data-hovercard-url="/users/Poketubepoggu/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
  data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/Poketubepoggu">@Poketubepoggu</a>)</li>

  <li>Brought back dark theme</li>

  <li>Fixed random playback failure due to 403 error</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug in the parser that caused some videos to fail to play (rare)</li>

  <li>Fixed slow buffering</li>

  <li>Fixed long videos (1 h+) taking too much time to load/not playing/crashing<br>

  Extremely long videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56lkofpjOAs"
  rel="nofollow">this</a> are still subject to unending loading/freeze/crash.</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug where the bottom of the video was stretched.</li>

  </ul>'
