update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Hi, I''m still supposed to be concentrating on my things,
  but it seems the app is broken and needs an update.<br>

  As always(?), YouTube has made some changes on their javascripts, which caused a
  parse error.</p>

  <p dir="auto">The only change from the last release is the fix for the parse issue.<br>

  Please wait a bit more until active development resumes!</p>'
