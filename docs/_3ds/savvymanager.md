update_notes: '<p dir="auto"><strong>UPDATE 9/10/2022:</strong> Fixed bug where custom
  character importing would either not work (in Citra) or cause a crash (on real hardware).</p>

  <h3 dir="auto">What''s new?</h3>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>All fashion items can now be added to <em>Fashion Forward</em> &amp; <em>Styling
  Star</em>!

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>This can be done in the stock menu, after selecting either game.</li>

  <li>The fashion items can be added to both the wardrobe and shop in <em>Styling
  Star</em>, but they can only be added to the wardrobe in <em>Fashion Forward</em>.</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>When importing a character from <em>Fashion Forward</em>''s save data into <em>Styling
  Star</em>, known removed fashion item(s) will now be substituted with other fashion
  items looking closely to the removed item(s) as possible.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3 dir="auto">Improvement</h3>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Slightly improved the <em>Fashion Forward</em> -&gt; <em>Styling Star</em> character
  importing and conversion process for importing from FF''s save data.

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>This means more contact colors, eyebrows, eyeshadows, blushers, and hairstyles
  will be properly converted.</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <h3 dir="auto">Bug fix</h3>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Citra is now checked in order for it to not show a stretched top screen.</li>

  </ul>'
