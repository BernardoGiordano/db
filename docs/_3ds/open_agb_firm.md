update_notes: '<p dir="auto">This is a build from the master branch for the impatient.</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>A bug got fixed that made games with no save type unplayable (white screen/other
  buggy behavior).</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto">The save type database was not created by me and i can''t vouch for
  its completeness or accuracy (i have not heard any complaints so far). Keep that
  in mind when using this build and backup your saves.<br>

  Also note that EEPROM savegames from some emulators or even flashcarts are incompatible
  because they are laid out wrong (every 8 bytes block of data is reversed). This
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/profi200/e06794d7561ed552c518b4b0b2f5f2f6">tool</a>
  can fix that.</p>

  <p dir="auto">The used scale matrix is the default "Sharp + edge enhance" one.</p>

  <p dir="auto"><strong>Known issues</strong><br>

  If the video output freezes after making a screenshot try pressing the HOME button.
  This works most of the time. This is due to a hard to track down bug and will be
  fixed later.</p>
