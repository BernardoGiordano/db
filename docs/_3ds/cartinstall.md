update_notes: '<p>Update 9/2/21: <strong>CartInstall is now deprecated. Please use
  GodMode9''s builtin feature to install your cartridges.</strong></p>

  <p>Changes since the last release:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Added EmuNAND support! I really had meant to do this a while ago, and forgot</li>

  <li>Fixed an alignment-related edge-case bug that would cause a crash on boot after
  installing in rare circumstances</li>

  <li>Switched to virtual mounting of DIFF partitions - this really has no use to
  the end user, but it''s cool behind the scenes, I promise</li>

  <li>Decided system update jokes were getting old</li>

  </ul>'
