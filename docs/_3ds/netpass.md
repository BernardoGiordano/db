update_notes: '<p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:21" dir="auto">First stable release!</p>&#x000A;<ul
  data-sourcepos="3:2-10:199" dir="auto">&#x000A;<li data-sourcepos="3:2-3:314">&#x000A;<strong
  data-sourcepos="3:4-3:23">User on-boarding</strong>: Upon startup up NetPass the
  user will now be asked to review our <a data-sourcepos="3:91-3:130" href="https://netpass.cafe/rules.html"
  rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">rules</a> and <a data-sourcepos="3:136-3:186"
  href="https://netpass.cafe/privacy.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">privacy
  policy</a>. After that, the user will be on-boarded easily to apply the patches
  to make SPR (receiving passes in the background) properly.</li>&#x000A;<li data-sourcepos="4:2-4:181">&#x000A;<strong
  data-sourcepos="4:4-4:18">Stand-alone</strong>: NetPass is now completely stand-alone
  and does not need Pretendo to work anymore. You can, of course, still use Pretendo
  if you want to. The two do not conflict.</li>&#x000A;<li data-sourcepos="5:2-5:191">&#x000A;<strong
  data-sourcepos="5:4-5:19">Integrations</strong>: You don''t want to use only NetPass''es
  SPR but also <a data-sourcepos="5:73-5:110" href="https://pretendo.network" rel="nofollow
  noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Pretendo''s</a>? That is easy now, just go
  to the integration settings and then enable Pretendo!</li>&#x000A;<li data-sourcepos="6:2-6:292">&#x000A;<strong
  data-sourcepos="6:4-6:23">Background music</strong>: You all have been asking for
  this, and waiting for this, and now it is finally here! NetPass now plays music
  in the background! This music is also different per-location, however not many locations
  have their own track yet. Stay tuned for more updates regarding this!</li>&#x000A;<li
  data-sourcepos="7:2-7:252">&#x000A;<strong data-sourcepos="7:4-7:51">More accurate
  interpretation of StreetPasses</strong>: StreetPass has a lot of features, some
  of them rather obscure and not a lot of titles use this. Now, more  of the obscure
  features of streetpass should work properly, broadening the supported titles.</li>&#x000A;<li
  data-sourcepos="8:2-8:239">&#x000A;<strong data-sourcepos="8:4-8:19">Special Miis</strong>:
  If you are doing a recurring donation, you can now have the NetPass server automatically
  mark your Mii in Mii Plaza as special. Miis that were marked special via other means
  will automatically be marked as normal Miis.</li>&#x000A;<li data-sourcepos="9:2-9:184">&#x000A;<strong
  data-sourcepos="9:4-9:39">Various small features and fixes</strong>: A lot of small
  bugs/issues have been fixed, along with also some bigger ones. Also some smaller
  features like an in-app about screen exist now!</li>&#x000A;<li data-sourcepos="10:2-10:199">&#x000A;<strong
  data-sourcepos="10:4-10:16">Stability</strong>: This is a big one: Soru considers
  NetPass so far into development now that it is stable enough to not have any major
  bugs anymore (hopefully....you know how it is with software &gt;.&lt;)</li>&#x000A;</ul>'
