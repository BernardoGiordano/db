update_notes: '<p>This is v0.2.0 of StackMill, which has the following changes:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>

  <p>[Important Derp Fix]: The AI used the Player Phase instead of AI Phase. That
  should now be fixed and the AI shouldn''t be weird anymore if the Player had the
  Jump Phase and the AI the Move Phase for example.</p>

  </li>

  <li>

  <p>Added a 50:50 AI Mode, which is slightly more difficult than the completely random
  one, however still easy beat-able. If you want a challenge, then ask one of your
  Friends or Family at home, to play against you! (Do NOTE, for that, the Stone on
  the AI Mode at the Settings (Second Tab / Middle Tab) must be set to the Red one
  (first one)).</p>

  </li>

  <li>

  <p>Rules: Now does color the selected Section on the bottom screen, so you know,
  at which section you are. You can also scroll with UP / DOWN now through the pages.</p>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <p>That''s pretty much all I believe that changed in the two commits that have been
  done until v0.2.0. Have fun. ~SuperSaiyajinStackZ</p>'
