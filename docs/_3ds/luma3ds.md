update_notes: '<ul dir="auto">

  <li>Fix older system versions (4.x to 8.x) not booting since Luma3DS v13.0

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>On 4.x, Arm11 custom sysmodules have been disabled. This means no Rosalina and
  no region-free; if you''re still on these system versions, please just upgrade after
  having installed Luma3DS.</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Fix emuNAND support for system version 5.0 (and possibly some other ancient
  system versions like this one). This was a long-standing issue</li>

  <li>Fix an issue where Arm11 svcBreak exceptions were not displayed as such since
  Luma3DS v13.0</li>

  <li>Fix an issue with plugins related to Home Menu notification</li>

  <li>Properly grant access to all Arm11-accessible IO to 3DSX homebrew</li>

  <li>Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments
  have been made to enhance the user experience</li>

  </ul>'
