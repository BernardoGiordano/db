update_notes: '<ul dir="auto">

  <li>The title says it, this release fix the HORRIBLE quality of previous SatellaZone</li>

  <li>Also rearanged some menus (and added a not found page for pages not findable,
  if you have a "specified file was not found on the server" error (NOT VIDEOS ON
  THE LITE EDITION because this is normal in this case!), please report it to us because
  this is not normal)</li>

  <li>IMPORTANT! Again, please delete the old romfs folder of Nintendo Zone because
  some files name changed again and the old ones will be unused and will take space
  for nothing.</li>

  <li>Special thanks to Spencer Everly for sending Nintendo Zone saved page!</li>
