update_notes: '<ul dir="auto">

  <li>For this release there is no hotspot method to watch the videos with the normal
  version. If you want to watch the videos you need to download the "LocalSatellaZone"
  version, the quality of the videos have been scaled down so the files are not too
  big. If the quality is too bad i will do another release with normal quality videos.</li>

  <li>Fixed a lot of pages with edited images</li>

  <li>New menu and pages</li>

  <li>Around 40 videos to watch !</li>

  <li>New easter egg (as always)</li>

  </ul>
