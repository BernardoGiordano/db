update_notes: '<h3 dir="auto">Improvements</h3>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Another debugging string has been added to the log.</li>

  <li>The program will now fail if the ROM is detected to not be on the SD card, or
  if a custom path is not set.

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Before this, it would silently succeed with the wrong path, or with the <code
  class="notranslate">/</code> character removed. This is no longer an issue and forces
  people to read the instructions on why it broke.</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <h3 dir="auto">Known issues</h3>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>DSiWare is not supported, as GameTDB does not provide box art for them (of course
  they don''t, they don''t come in a box.)</li>

  </ul>'
