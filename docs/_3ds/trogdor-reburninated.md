update_notes: '<h3>New Features:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>Added <strong>Knight Movement</strong> option: "Original" retains the Flash
  version''s behavior, while "New" (default) is similar to how knights move in the
  HTML5 version (reworked some code from <a href="https://github.com/jeremyelkayam/trogba">Trogba</a>
  for this one)</li>

  <li>Added <strong>Chance</strong> preset: Enemy speeds and behaviors are shuffled
  at the start of each level, and level order is also shuffled! Do you feel lucky?</li>

  <li>Added <strong>Sound Test</strong>: Listen to songs, sound effects, and Strong
  Bad whenever you want!</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>Fixed level 31 being unbeatable due to the player spawning inside a cottage</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug where high scores wouldn''t always save</li>

  <li>Fixed autosave not happening under specific circumstances</li>

  <li>Fixed the Level Beaten smoke animation replaying for a single frame</li>

  <li>Fonts and graphics are now packaged into the executable for neatness (audio
  is still separate). More importantly, <strong>startup load times are greatly improved
  on consoles</strong></li>

  <li>[PSP] Fixed console crash, meaning <strong>the game now works on real PSP hardware
  again</strong> (sorry for the wait on this one)</li>

  <li>Other minor bug fixes</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Other:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>[GAMECUBE] Added beta <strong>Gamecube build</strong></li>

  <li><strong>Updated SDL2 libraries</strong> on most, if not all, systems</li>

  <li>Renamed "Mips''s Choice" preset to "Mode 8" to reflect my new username</li>

  <li>Renamed "Knight Behavior" option to "Respawn Behavior"</li>

  <li>Other minor text changes</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>

  <p><strong>UPDATE 2/28/24</strong>: Updated Gamecube build to add GBA demo and (possibly)
  audio. I can''t fully test this for myself since I don''t have a Gamecube, so audio
  and save data may or may not work.</p>'
