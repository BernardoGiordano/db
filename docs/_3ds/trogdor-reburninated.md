update_notes: '<p dir="auto">The v2.0 update is here!</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Added <strong>Frame Rate</strong> setting; you can now play at higher frame
  rates instead of being limited to the original game''s 16 FPS!

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>PC goes up to 144 FPS, consoles go up to 60, and 3DS goes up to 30</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Added <strong>save data support</strong> for settings, high scores, unlocked
  cheats, and mid-game progress (the idea for that last one is <del>shamelessly stolen
  from</del> inspired by <a href="https://github.com/jeremyelkayam/trogba">Trogba</a>)</li>

  <li>Added the following options:

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li><strong>Arrow Speed</strong>: Self-explanatory</li>

  <li><strong>Knight Speed</strong>: Self-explanatory</li>

  <li><strong>Knight Behavior</strong>: Makes knights continue moving in a constant
  pattern after you lose a life, similar to the HTML5 port</li>

  <li><strong>Shuffle Levels</strong>: Shuffles the level order so it''s different
  every time you play</li>

  <li><strong>Level Transition</strong>: Lets you leave the Level Beaten screen by
  pressing the Confirm button instead of waiting for it to happen automatically (thanks
  again, Trogba!)</li>

  <li><strong>Speedy Mode (cheat)</strong>: Lets you move up to 2x as fast</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li><strong>Difficulty Presets</strong>: Too many settings to dig through? Just
  choose one of the five new presets! Your high score is saved for each preset.</li>

  <li><strong>Restructured menu</strong> into multiple sub-menus instead of everything
  being lumped together</li>

  <li>Added <strong>"Reset to Default" menu button</strong> that resets all settings
  to default except screen scaling</li>

  <li>Added Doom-style <strong>Quit confirmation screen</strong></li>

  <li>You can now press Start at the title screen to skip it</li>

  <li>Big Head Mode is now a normal setting instead of a cheat</li>

  <li>Changed several menu text strings</li>

  <li>Assorted polish, optimizations, and minor bug fixes</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto">One more thing: The PSP port currently has issues that will be fixed
  at a later date, so the new PSP release is experimental. If you want something more
  stable for PSP, fall back to v1.1 for now.</p>

  <p dir="auto">Enjoy!</p>

  <p dir="auto"><strong>Hotfix 3/10/23</strong>: Removed unused graphics from downloads
  (it''s only ~200KB when zipped, but still).</p>'
