A Work-in-Progress Quake "demake" of the Zombies mode from Call of Duty.

The game itself is mostly feature-equivalent with Call of Duty: World at War on a generic level. Gameplay components are implemented, with some parity differences, but most World at War maps and their gimmicks are not yet represented. Various small features from Call of Duty: Black Ops are present, but not on as wide of a scale as compared to World at War.

Oh yeah, we have lots of bugs, too.
