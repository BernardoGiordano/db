update_notes: '<p dir="auto">3DSident has been re-written in C++ which makes use of
  the latest versions of devkitARM and libctru. This release will only be available
  with the slightly refreshed GUI version. I don''t really have time to maintain two
  separate versions. I barely have time to maintain this project, considering its
  been over like 6 years since the last "final" release. Although there will always
  be room for improvement, this version is based on a much cleaner code base. Unlike
  the previous versions of 3DSident, this version does not initialize every service
  used or constantly refresh values that do not change over time. Theoretically, this
  should fix crashes on certain devices that some users have been experiencing.</p>

  <p dir="auto">Change-log:</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Clean up services that are not constantly used by the UI.</li>

  <li>GUI has been slightly refreshed with icons representing each category. (GUI
  also uses a dark mode UI)</li>

  <li>Fix running hardware check in the system category.</li>

  <li>Display "check digit" with the serial number in the system category.</li>

  <li>Display battery temperature (both °C/°F) in the battery category.</li>

  </ul>'
