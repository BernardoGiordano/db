  update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Hello, i know it''s been a while since i have uploaded
    any progress or anything, and i''m sorry for that.<br>

    I just kind of lost the motivation to do it at some point, i don''t even know
    why, my brain is cursed. I''m also working on other things in the background,
    and then ofc i have school.<br>

    But despite this, this project is still in the back of my head every day but i
    just don''t know how to start it again.<br>

    I have some ideas, but not a proper way to put them on paper, or rather on code
    you could say.</p>

    <p dir="auto">So what i''m going to do is this : you can have the latest beta
    build of CtrRGBPAT2.<br>

    This build includes : support for custom low-battery LED. Yep, that''s right.
    It''s actually been a bit more than a year since i knew how to make it work.<br>

    However, since it''s a beta build, i haven''t made an actual menu thing to make
    it work, so here are the button combinations :</p>

    <ul dir="auto">

    <li>Y to enter debug mode (indicated by the text at the top right of the screen)</li>

    </ul>

    <p dir="auto">While in debug mode :</p>

    <ul dir="auto">

    <li>X to reset all patterns to default (will automatically install the file, so
    be careful with this as you will lose your currently installed custom patterns)</li>

    <li>The 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th menu entries are to set the low-battery LED since
    the low-battery sequence is composed of 4 parts (when you click on any of them,
    a 2 hex characters input will be shown). Input 55 everywhere to make it go back
    to normal blink.<br>

    To apply the custom low-battery pattern, use the "test pattern" menu entry (while
    still in debug mode).<br>

    More info on how to make your custom pattern here : <a href="https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/MCURTC:SetBatteryEmptyLEDPattern"
    rel="nofollow">https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/MCURTC:SetBatteryEmptyLEDPattern</a>
    (i made this documentation page)</li>

    <li>You can force the battery LED status with L and R, more info on the different
    values here : <a href="https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/MCUHWC:SetPowerLEDPattern"
    rel="nofollow">https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/MCUHWC:SetPowerLEDPattern</a></li>

    <li>When you test a pattern, a bunch of numbers will print. That''s normal, and
    they will go away if you move up or down in the menu, or if you simply press B</li>

    </ul>

    <p dir="auto">I think that''s all with this debug build. About the next release,
    i''ll see what i will do. But please, do not hesitate to make a pull request if
    you have ideas, i will gladly review them.</p>

update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Hey ! I''m not dead ! :D</p>

  <p dir="auto">Anyway here''s what''s new :</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>I''m on the Universal updater ! Yipeeeeee !</li>

  <li>Fixed crash of force exit of the app (finally, i knew those std::strings were
  evil)</li>

  <li>Also you can now go back to the HOME menu again if you want</li>

  <li>Fixed a few visual glitches</li>

  <li>The unknown pattern is now known : it triggers when you boot your DS or you
  exit sleep mode (can make for some cool transitions)</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto">The roadmap also has been updated with some ideas from Semka (thx)</p>

  <p dir="auto">I''m definitely not done with this yet, i still have a few things
  i want to implement but also i don''t have the time. This is kind of like a fun
  project so please don''t mind the unfrequent updates, thank you</p>

  <p dir="auto">Have fun ! :)</p>

# CtrRGBPAT2
This 3DS application allows the LED color to be changed. In order for this to work, Luma CFW (custom firmware) needs to be installed.
Thanks to [CPunch](https://github.com/CPunch/CtrRGBPATTY/) for the original project !

## Features
Customize the LED color and pattern for when you receive notifications ! Whether SpotPass, StreetPass, online Friends, or more (Yes, there's more) ! Why keep the default blue when you can have a cool-looking purple for example ðŸ˜Ž

Everything is simple and made so you cannot possibly screw something up (or else you really wanted to)

## Upcoming
- Save and restore feature
- Proper UI ?

Hope you enjoy ! :)
