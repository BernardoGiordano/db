update_notes: '<p>v1.2.0 Release</p>

  <ul>

  <li>This release is for the PS Vita only. For other systems, go to <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/DDLC-LOVE/releases/tag/v1.1.9">v1.1.9</a></li>

  <li>I wanted to replay DDLC, but on my PS Vita, so I updated DDLC-LOVE to fix some
  things that I encountered during my time playing/reading (even though I don''t really
  want to mess with this code I made anymore)</li>

  <li>With this release, the main change beside bug fixes is that <strong>I switched
  to using Lua Player Plus Vita (lpp-vita)</strong></li>

  </ul>'
