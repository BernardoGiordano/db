update_notes: "<p>The main point of this release is because previous versions introduced\
  \ a nasty bug when using the multiple file select option. If the user selects the\
  \ parent folder and proceeds to delete, you can possibly wipe/format your entire\
  \ SD card. However I've been itching to re-write 3DShell for a while now, and almost\
  \ 2 years after here it is. Do note it is tagged as <em>BETA</em> because some important\
  \ features such as FTP, audio playback(probably will be entirely removed), and archive\
  \ support. Most if not all of these features will slowly be re-implemented and bought\
  \ up with minor updates which you will be able to update within the app itself.\
  \ Anyways here are the changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File browser now displays twice as\
  \ many files as previous versions (5 -&gt; 10).</li>\n<li>Selector now properly\
  \ follows input and doesn't just stay at the bottom of the screen.</li>\n<li>3DShell's\
  \ screenshot feature has been completely removed. (Rosalina already has a screenshot\
  \ function so we don't need this here).</li>\n<li>There are no longer any nightly\
  \ updates. The updates option in settings will instead download and install the\
  \ latest release from GitHub if your application is not up to date.</li>\n<li>Storage\
  \ bar is back.</li>\n<li>When viewing an image you can press \"X\" to view some\
  \ properties like the name, width and height.</li>\n<li>Removed many unused assets\
  \ and compressed a few (file icons are a lot smaller now) icons.</li>\n<li>A lot\
  \ of under the hood changes, clean-ups that aren't necessary to list here.</li>\n\
