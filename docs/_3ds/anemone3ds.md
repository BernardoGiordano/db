  update_notes: '<p dir="auto">I doubt many people were expecting a new Anemone3DS
    release - frankly I didn''t really expect to do more work on it, but life''s funny
    like that I guess. This is probably the biggest update we''ve done in a long while,
    and I haven''t had the time to test everything thoroughly, so we''re going to
    release it as a pre-release first and hope nothing breaks too bad ðŸ˜„. I also want
    a few more languages supported (ideally Spanish and Japanese) before the full
    release, but more on that later!</p>

    <h2 dir="auto">Bugfixes</h2>

    <ul dir="auto">

    <li>Fixed various errors when downloading themes via the QR code reader

    <ul dir="auto">

    <li>Fix bug with files with * in their name (by <a class="user-mention notranslate"
    data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/Zemogiter/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
    data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/Zemogiter">@Zemogiter</a>)</li>

    <li>Fix bugs with Unicode filenames</li>

    <li>Allow x-zip-compressed to be a valid Mime type</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>Disable home button after installing theme; this was deemed to be the root
    of a number of corruption issues</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 dir="auto">New Features</h2>

    <ul dir="auto">

    <li>Translation framework allowing for Anemone3DS to be displayed in your native
    language! Currently only Portugese and French are present, but we''re accepting
    PRs for more languages - feel free to message me or ping me on ThemePlaza or Nintendo
    Homebrew if you want instructions!

    <ul dir="auto">

    <li>Added French translation by <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user"
    data-hovercard-url="/users/cooolgamer/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
    data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/cooolgamer">@cooolgamer</a></li>

    <li>Added Portuguese translation by <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user"
    data-hovercard-url="/users/iveurne/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
    data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/iveurne">@iveurne</a></li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>Support for Korean region systems using the home menu patch (thanks to <a
    class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/cooolgamer/hovercard"
    data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/cooolgamer">@cooolgamer</a>)</li>

    <li>assemble a splash preview if none was found (thanks to <a class="user-mention
    notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/Jan200101/hovercard"
    data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/Jan200101">@Jan200101</a>)</li>

    <li>Significant performance improvements, especially when scrolling between many
    themes</li>

    <li>New User Interface which should be both more intuitive (no more button combos!)
    and also more touch-screen friendly</li>

    <li>Respect Parental Controls which lock the user out of the browser and require
    a PIN on access if that restriction is enabled</li>

    <li>Warn the user on installing a theme with mono audio - this can cause many
    audio issues with the home menu</li>

    <li>Add libcurl fallback so that Anemone can scan QR Codes from anywhere - not
    just HTTP websites.</li>

    </ul>

update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Sup gamers, just a patch release this time around. Of
  note this time around is that, if you have dumped official themes in the past, it
  didn''t actually work - so you may have to scramble around and dump them again.
  Sorry about that.</p>

  <h2 dir="auto">In this patch</h2>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Dumping and then installing official themes caused a crash because the themes
  were never actually dumped; <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user"
  data-hovercard-url="/users/LiquidFenrir/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
  data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/LiquidFenrir">@LiquidFenrir</a>
  patched it.</li>

  <li>There were some problems with our audio thread, including not being joined back
  to the main thread on exit, causing bizarre crashes; that''s been patched, again
  by <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/LiquidFenrir/hovercard"
  data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/LiquidFenrir">@LiquidFenrir</a>.</li>

  <li>Some of you may have noticed that the error <code class="notranslate">FS Error:
  ...</code> would appear when downloading themes with certain special characters
  in them. That was my (<a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user"
  data-hovercard-url="/users/Helloman892/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
  data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/Helloman892">@Helloman892</a>''s)
  fault in v2.3.0, and you know what''s next: patched.</li>

  <li>Somewhat related to the above, searching for special characters in the TP browser
  has been broken for a while. Patched.</li>

  <li>There was another bug introduced in v2.3.0 as part of the networking overhaul;
  a useless-to-the-user 404 would be shown if a theme preview in the browser had no
  BGM. Patched.</li>

  <li>The Theme Plaza browser should crash less where previews are involved, thanks
  to yet another patch from <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user"
  data-hovercard-url="/users/LiquidFenrir/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
  data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/LiquidFenrir">@LiquidFenrir</a>,
  without whom this patch release wouldn''t be happening.</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto">That besides, sorry this took a while to come out, and especially
  sorry for so many of you thinking you needed to get a new SD card! I really should
  have made that error more descriptive...</p>

  <h2 dir="auto">And here''s a download QR to use with FBI</h2>
