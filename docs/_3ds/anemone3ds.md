update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Sup gamers, just a patch release this time around. Of
  note this time around is that, if you have dumped official themes in the past, it
  didn''t actually work - so you may have to scramble around and dump them again.
  Sorry about that.</p>

  <h2 dir="auto">In this patch</h2>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Dumping and then installing official themes caused a crash because the themes
  were never actually dumped; <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user"
  data-hovercard-url="/users/LiquidFenrir/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
  data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/LiquidFenrir">@LiquidFenrir</a>
  patched it.</li>

  <li>There were some problems with our audio thread, including not being joined back
  to the main thread on exit, causing bizarre crashes; that''s been patched, again
  by <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/LiquidFenrir/hovercard"
  data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/LiquidFenrir">@LiquidFenrir</a>.</li>

  <li>Some of you may have noticed that the error <code class="notranslate">FS Error:
  ...</code> would appear when downloading themes with certain special characters
  in them. That was my (<a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user"
  data-hovercard-url="/users/Helloman892/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
  data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/Helloman892">@Helloman892</a>''s)
  fault in v2.3.0, and you know what''s next: patched.</li>

  <li>Somewhat related to the above, searching for special characters in the TP browser
  has been broken for a while. Patched.</li>

  <li>There was another bug introduced in v2.3.0 as part of the networking overhaul;
  a useless-to-the-user 404 would be shown if a theme preview in the browser had no
  BGM. Patched.</li>

  <li>The Theme Plaza browser should crash less where previews are involved, thanks
  to yet another patch from <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user"
  data-hovercard-url="/users/LiquidFenrir/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
  data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/LiquidFenrir">@LiquidFenrir</a>,
  without whom this patch release wouldn''t be happening.</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto">That besides, sorry this took a while to come out, and especially
  sorry for so many of you thinking you needed to get a new SD card! I really should
  have made that error more descriptive...</p>

  <h2 dir="auto">And here''s a download QR to use with FBI</h2>
