update_notes: '<h2 dir="auto">Base luma version: v13.1.1</h2>

  <h3 dir="auto">2024-5-25:</h3>

  <p dir="auto">Fixed some homebrews apps like <strong>bootntr</strong> having different
  behavior depending of the luma version and crashes because this isn''t the right
  one. The base luma version is now used for them so they can work correctly and the
  correct Starlight3DS version is shown on menus like config and rosalina menu.</p>

  <h3 dir="auto">2024-5-27:</h3>

  <p dir="auto">Changed version string on rosalina menu that previously indicated
  the wrong version</p>'

**Starlight3DS** is a fork of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS) with the goal of adding more features. This was inspired and took from [DullPointer](https://github.com/DullPointer)'s Luma3DS fork and updated on the latest Luma3DS version.
This modified Luma3DS adds many features such as Day/Night mode (lite), shortcuts to toggle certain things like wifi or bottom screen, cut wifi in sleep mode to save battery, QOL improvements and more!
You can view the full list of added features in the [Readme of the github repository](https://github.com/cooolgamorg/Starlight3DS?tab=readme-ov-file#changes-with-the-official-build)
