update_notes: '<p dir="auto">This game is pretty simple, and I think you''ll like
  it!<br>

  Watch the video in the readme to understand it better!</p>

  <p dir="auto">The .cia file is only useful if you have a CFW.<br>

  If you only have access to the HBL, simply download the .3dsx file.</p>

  <p dir="auto">Both work just as fine, but the .cia version has the added benefits
  of having a neat handmade banner, and being able to be launched directly from the
  Home Menu!</p>'
